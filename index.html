        <p id="titles">Short Bio</p> </br> <p> My name is Anthony Hayward, before I started Code Fellows I was a Nutritionist at a company called 30/10 Weight Loss for Life. I did that for about 3 years, until the pandemic hit and shut us down. I have always had a passion for photography and film, and have ran my own business for the past 12 years. Photography has given me a passport to the world, and I have been lucky enough to do some great wolrd travelling, including places like Africa, Ethiopia, India, Alaska, Bali, Thailand, and a few others. You can view some of my photos work at <a href="www.anthony-hayward.com">anthony-hayward.com</a>.  </p>
